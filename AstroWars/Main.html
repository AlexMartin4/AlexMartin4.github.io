	<h2>About</h2>
	This game is a 2-player space strategy game. While the structure of the game play is turned based,
	all the action happens in real time. Maneuver your ships cleverly and make good use of your weapons
	to wipe out the opposing team!
	<br>
	
	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	Download the zip-file below and run the AstroWars.exe executable file. 
	You can play this game with a keyboard and mouse. Keyboard shortcuts are indicated below.

	<h2>Game Manual</h2>
	<h3>Basics</h3><br>
	
	Each turn, you will take turns planning the 
	movement and actions of their space ships (ideally while your opponent looks away). Once you are
	satisfied, you may hit the "End Turn" button to let your opponent play. After the second player is 
	done, hitting the end turn button will trigger the realtime phase. During that time, neither player 
	can act until the next planning phase. The game ends when both ships on either team have been destroyed.
	<br><br>
	
	<h3>Movement</h3><br>
	<br>
	
	<h3>Resources</h3><br>
	
	Each ship has limited Hull and Fuel. Getting hit will depleate Hull, if Hull reaches 0, the ship is
	destroyed. Using the thrust engine will depleate Fuel, if Fuel reaches 0, ships still move but are unable to
	thrust foward, making them mostly inert.

	<h3>Weapons</h3>
	<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img class= "table-image" src="../ImageResources/Direct.png"></td>
    <td><b>Direct Missile: </b> Fires a missile in the chosen direction. This is hard to hit but
				the damage and effect area make up for it.</td>
    <td><img class= "table-image" src="../ImageResources/Guided.png"></td>
	<td><b>Guided Missile: </b> Fires a guided missile that will track any target (including friendlies!)
				in front of it. While is is weaker than the direct missile, it is easier to hit with. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img class= "table-image" src="../ImageResources/Precision.png"></td>
    <td><b>Precision Laser: </b> Fires a laser in a staight line. High damage but a long cooldown.</td>
    <td><img class= "table-image" src="../ImageResources/Scatter.png"></td>
	<td><b>Scatter Laser: </b> Fires an array of 5 lasers in a given direction. This is great to shoot
			down incoming missiles.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img class= "table-image" src="../ImageResources/MineAW.png"></td>
    <td><b>Mines: </b>	Creates three mines behind the ship. Mines detonate when any
						ship comes into contact with them dealing significant damage.</td>
    <td><img class= "table-image" src="../ImageResources/Poison.png"></td>
	<td><b>Nuclear Missile: </b>Fires a missile in the given direction. The missile explodes on		
								its own and releases a radioactive cloud which damages ships inside it.</td>
